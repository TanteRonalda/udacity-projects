# Landing Page Project

## Instructions

To start off Udacity provided a static version of a Landing Page, that had to be converted into an interactive one. This required modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

## Functionality

- the navigation menu at the top is built dynamically as more sections are added. For testing purposes, a fourth section was here added as required by the rubric
- if an item in the navigation menu is clicked, the corresponding HTML list item gets assigned the class "active". When a different item is clicked, the class is removed.
- if a section is in viewport, that section is highlighted (background color changes) and the correspponding sections gets assigned the class "in-view". When it's no longer in viewport, the class is removed.
- When clicking an item in the navigation menu, the page scrolls to the corresponding section

## Warning of plagiarism

I would like to address the “first warning of plagiarism”, that I received after my latest submission. 

I understand, that Udacity takes plagiarism very seriously and that copying another student’s work is inacceptable. 

When working on my project, I have looked at an amount of other peoples work - to get an idea how they were tackling the problems and also, because going through their code is helping me a lot with understanding, how different problems can be addressed and solved.

I would like to point out though, that I HAVE NOT copied code form any source,

The repository  https://github.com/akristic/landing-page which is stated to be my main potential source in the plagiarism warning, I have NEVER opened before. Comparing the two now, I do see the similarities in the logic of some functions but I don't find it  justified to say that I have copied the entire scope. 

As for the second potential source mentioned https://github.com/musaabhasan/fend2, I have also NEVER opened this one, however the user sounds familiar because because he posted in the Help Forum, as he was experiencing similar issues with his code to check whether a section is in viewport. I was having similar problems (which I also posted about in the Help Forum). I do understand, that I may have drawn a little too heavy on the code he posted with his question to fix mine, so that they ended up looking very much alike.

-> That particular function I have now reworked and cited the source of the helper function (dimensions of viewport) in the code. That also wasn't an original from musaabhasan. 

-> I have also included a lot more comments in the code, because I do understand it, which would also not be the case if I had just copy & pasted it.
