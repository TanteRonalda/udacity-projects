# Landing Page Project

## Important note
This repository was solely created for the submission & review process at Udacity.
If you wish to review the commits and history of this project please go to my [this folder in my other repository](https://github.com/TanteRonalda/udacity-projects/tree/main/project2_landing-page), where this project was orginally developed.

(I am still figuring out GitHub and wasn't aware that you were supposed to create a new repository for each project. I thought they could all be stored in one)

### Instructions

To start off Udacity provided a static version of a Landing Page, that had to be converted into an interactive one. This required modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

### Behavior

- navigation menu is dynamically build according to the number of sections in the document
- click on navigation item smooth-scrolls to corresponding section
- sections are highlighted when in viewport
- the navigation item of a section is also highlighted when that section is in viewport

### Methods

To achieve this behavior a variety of JS methods were used, such as for of loops, conditionals, functions and eventListeners for click and scroll.

### Warning of plagiarism

Thanks for not finding me guilty of plagiarism after all... 
I take this programm very seriously and fully understand that copying someone elses work is not getting me anywhere. Going through other peoples code is nice to get a deeper understanding of all the possibilities that there are to solve a problem, but that's about it.

Cheers.
