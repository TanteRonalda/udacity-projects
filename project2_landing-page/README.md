# Landing Page Project

## Instructions

To start off Udacity provided a static version of a Landing Page, that had to be converted into an interactive one. This required modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

## Functionality

- the navigation menu at the top is built dynamically as more sections are added. For testing purposes, a fourth section was here added as required by the rubric
- if an item in the navigation menu is clicked, the corresponding HTML list item gets assigned the class "active". When a different item is clicked, the class is removed.
- if a section is in viewport, that section is highlighted (background color changes) and the correspponding sections gets assigned the class "in-view". When it's no longer in viewport, the class is removed.
- When clicking an item in the navigation menu, the page scrolls to the corresponding section

The code was written by Hanna Grube.
